People are concerned with social, environmental, and economic issues. After conducting thorough interviews on people ages 18-24, we concluded that many people want to help change the world, but they are not sure how they can make a global impact. We are building a website that promotes resources and opportunities so that people can educate themselves on ways to help through widespread collaboration.
